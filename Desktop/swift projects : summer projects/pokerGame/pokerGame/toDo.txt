Bugs Noticed toDo:
    fix the option for the big blind so that they have the option if no one raises

    check if only one person every time you move around the circle,
    not only between when cards come out. could be check in next()
    to see if next returns the starting person

    min raise amount on preflop action must be larger than the first raise,
    or if no first raise then the size of the small blind. Right now allows
    for a reraise to be the size of the small blind not at least the
    size of the first raise

    better randomize for choosing dealer and shuffling deck

Moving Forward toDo:

    begin work on simple bot. need a way to share info with the bot
    without player being able to use the table class. need way to share
    the info every time the player must make a decision. can use templated
    types

    multi table tourney, combining tables (concurrent/parallel programming?)

    create database for users profiles / login

Info Bot Needs:

    Hand Eval for less than 7 cards

    Num Players In Hand folded/all in/alive

    players stack sizes/positions

    bot position

    bot hand

    pot size

    board

    bets/raises/reraises

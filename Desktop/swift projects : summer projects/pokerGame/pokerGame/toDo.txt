Bugs Noticed toDo:

    min raise amount on preflop action must be larger than the first raise,
    or if no first raise then the size of the small blind. Right now allows
    for a reraise to be the size of the small blind not at least the
    size of the first raise

    closerCompareOfHands function needs testing, noticed bug for high card
    in closer compare

Moving Forward toDo:

    polymorphic players need to be allowed so players need functions such as
    call, fold, allin, etc to be under player class, not in table class

    begin work on simple bot

    multi table tourney, combining tables (concurrent programming?)

    create database for users
